Additionally, both bombings are linked to an explosion at an apartment at 26-49 96th Street in East Elmhurst in Queens, New York.  This apartment was being used as a bomb factory for FALN members, and police confiscated 66 sticks of dynamite, 2 carbines, a shot gun, and chemicals, used to make bombs, as well as three pipe bombs which later exploded at the police bomb disposal center.  Additionally, 14 printed communiqués were found, similar to those delivered to the Associated Press and United Press International in the past.  These communiqués were to warn of the bombings at the department stores that evening. One suspected FALN member, William Morales, who was a member of the National Commission of the Episcopal Church for Hispanic Affairs which had been suspected as an FALN front, was injured during the explosion in the apartment, and was later arrested after being released from the hospital.  He was under investigation by police in regards to his affiliation with FALN and the bombings.","Judith Cummings, New York Times, July 14, 1978.","Richard T.
