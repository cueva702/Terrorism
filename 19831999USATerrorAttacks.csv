An hour later, around 12pm, about three hours prior to the robbery, the perpetrators unloaded several boxes of roofing nails into a highway tunnel, hoping to cause a traffic jam due to flat tires, and further divert police.  However, the traffic jam failed, and traffic proceeded as usual. Around 3:00pm, the robbery took place.

In addition to the twelve perpetrators who committed the robbery, a former Brink's employee, Charles E.

Strout was eventually indicted, and sentenced to 5 years for racketeering.  Of the 12 perpetrators, Andrew Barnhill, Randolph Duey, James Dye, Randall Evans, Richard Kemp, Bruce Pierce, Gary Yarbrough, Robert Merki, Richard Scutari, Denver Parmenter were charged with armored car robbery and various other racketeering charges under the RICO Act.  It is unclear whether each of them was convicted for this particular incident, but overall, all ten of them were sentenced for their crimes with the Order after either trials or plea agreements, and received a range of prison sentences.

The tower was toppled when the perpetrators dismantled support cables and unscrewed bolts that held the tower in place. Though no electricity was lost or interrupted because the current was automatically switched to an alternate power transmission line, the incident caused $126,000 in loss to the company in equipment and services to restore the power line.

The Director of the Center, Peter Gerone, was among those who received a letter; it was opened by his secretary, but there were no injuries as she used an envelope opener. These letters were part of an 80-letter razor-blade campaign, claimed by the animal rights group, The Justice Department.  The group targeted scientists, many specifically from Regional Primate Centers across America, who were conducting AIDS and cancer-related research on non-human primates, and the group was against the use of primates for laboratory tests.  A communiqué claiming the incident was posted on both The Justice Department's  website as well as that of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In all, the communiqué listed eleven Tulane researchers as targets.

The Justice Department is an animal rights group, much like the Animal Liberation Front (ALF).  The group was also active in Canada and England (where it was initially based).  The Justice Department also committed a razor blade campaign in August 1999 against the fur industry.
